This port contains on-the-fly patches for pkgmk.

In order to use one of these patches you have the include it in your
Pkgfile:

	Depends on: port-on-rails
	...
	. /usr/lib/port-on-rails/enable-XXX

Every patch changes a specific behavior of pkgmk only when your port
is built.

Instead of depending on this port (port-on-rails) you may distribute
any of these patches with your port.
