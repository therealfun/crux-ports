# Include the file:

# in your pkgmk.conf, in order to make pkgmk automatically use
# these mirrors (when the original sources are unavailable).
#
# Be aware that some sources might be saved with
#   https://github.com/therealfun/crux-ports/blob/master/pkgmk.conf/FS0923.orig
# enabled, and be present as "name-version.tar.gz" instead of "version.tar.gz".
# An workaround could be for FS0923 to make a symlink (version->name-version),
# and that symlink could be on the mirrors too.
