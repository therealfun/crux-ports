Make sure you have CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y enabled in kernel:

  General setup
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support

Optional, you may want to enable CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER=y too:

  Device Drivers
    Generic Driver Options
      [*] Support for uevent helper

Run the post-install script
or create /etc/umkinitramfs/ and copy from /usr/share/umkinitramfs at least
00-init, 30-find_root, 50-mount_root and 80-switch_root

Duplicate the current entry from your boot manager and add to it

	initrd=/boot/initrd

Generate the initrd with:

	umkinitramfs /boot/initrd `uname -r`

Check the generated init script (printed on stdout), reboot and see if
the new boot entry works.

Change the files from /etc/umkinitramfs for your needs and add other
files from /usr/share/umkinitramfs.

If you want to force an initrd shell in order to debug the /init script,
add to the new boot entry:

	forcerescue

and once you get the rescue shell, disable the kernel output to console:

	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk

read the init script:

	cat /init

and start running commands one by one.
