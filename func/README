I see 3 use cases:

1) To have unattended builds, without a chroot
   and almost without touching the real root /

	sysupc(1)
	FUNC_ROOT=/ depinstc...
	FUNC_ROOT=/ func pkgmk...

2) To build a chroot from crux.nu (by the root user)

	func-create(8)
	func-configure(8)
	func-upgrade(8)

3) To test ports inside the above chroot

	depinstc
	func prt-get...
	func pkgmk...

	unionfs-fuse
	proot - optional if 

(2) doesn't needs a special dependency installed
(1) and (3) need unionfs-fuse + (proot or namespace support)

Proot is slower, can't enforce read-only mounts, but works with ports
like dcron or dbus (which create files owned by special users).

The minimal namespace support is:
 - mount_namespaces(7) (check /proc/self/ns/mnt, probably already enabled)
 - user_namespaces(7)  (check /proc/self/ns/user, probably not enabled)
