#
# With the official pkgmk, the settings from /etc/pkgmk.conf
# (eg. PKGMK_KEEP_WORK) take precedence over the command line options
# (eg. --keep-work). This patch switch this order.
#
# The current order in which the PKGMK_ variables are set is:
#   a) defaults hard-coded in pkgmk
#   b) options from the command line (parse_options() is called)
#   c) settings from /etc/pkgmk.conf
# This patch adds another call to parse_options(). Because this is done
# in step (c), this script should be the last one sourced/included
# by /etc/pkgmk.conf, to avoid missing some settings.
#
# It was inspired from Alan's patch:
#   makes command-line options take priority over pkgmk.conf options
