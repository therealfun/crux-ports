# This patch enables some hardening options.

#	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart
#
# NOTES:
# 
# Building gcc with --enable-default-pie could be better
# than the PIE options below. Programs having problems with this
# should have --no-pie already in place.
#
# dmesg | grep NX
#
# -z noexecstack
#  The marking is done automatically by recent GCC versions (objects
# using trampolines on the stack are marked as requiring executable
# stack, all other newly built objects are marked as not requiring it)
# and linker collects these markings into marking of the whole binary or
# shared library.
#
# It looks like programs already have read-only relocations ("-Wl,-z,relro")
# 
# A lot of ports ignore the link flags.
#
# SSP, PIE come with speed penalty. BINDNOW slows down the startup.
