#
# This patch tries to add a feature from Alan's patch:
#   keep the work directory only if the build fails
#   (PKGMK_KEEP_WORK="failed")
#
# http://www.mizrahi.com.ve/crux/ports/pkgutils/0001-New-features-and-small-improvements-in-pkgmk.patch
#
# Uncomment the line below to enable this feature.
# PKGMK_KEEP_WORK=failed

#
# We patch the build_package() function
# to call remove_work_dir() either PKGMK_KEEP_WORK=no (default)
# or PKGMK_KEEP_WORK=failed and the build was successful.
#

. <(
	declare -f build_package \
	| sed 's/\("$PKGMK_KEEP_WORK" = "no"\)/ \1 ] || [ $PKGMK_KEEP_WORK = failed -a $BUILD_SUCCESSFUL = yes /'
)
