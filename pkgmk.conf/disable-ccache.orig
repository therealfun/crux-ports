#
# This patch disables ccache when building some ports.
#
# The reason you may want to do this is that some ports have a low cache
# hit rate when building another version (updates). The Linux Kernel
# has ~2% hit rate, and even rebuilding the same version but with 
# the CK patches has only ~10% hit rate.
#
# The use of ccache with a cold ccache directory is not free. The speed
# penalty is difficult to pin point because it depends on how you use
# cccache (direct or preprocessing), it you run it in a container (what
# kind) or not, but a 20-50% speed drop is not uncommon with a 0% hit rate.
# 

# We don't test if cccache is enabled, as it can be enabled in many ways
# (eg. CC=/usr/bin/ccache)

# The ccache will still be executed, but it shouldn't matter too much.
# Avoiding the ccache execution is not simple, as ccache can be enabled
# in serveral ways (for example, by making a symlink /home/user/bin/gcc ->
# /usr/bin/ccache and add /home/user/bin to path).
