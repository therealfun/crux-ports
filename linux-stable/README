This port will use your active configuration (/proc/config.gz)
if /boot/config doesn't exist.

!!! grub support is not tested yet

Your boot manager (lilo, syslinux, grub) must be configured to use at
least two entries: /boot/vmlinuz and /boot/vmlinuz.old. When this is done
(and working), the post-install script should work too.

pkgadd will add/install the following files:
  the kernel built by this Pkgfile:
    - /boot/next (the 'uname -r' output of the kernel)
    - /boot/vmlinuz.next (the kernel)
    - /boot/System.map.next
    - /lib/modules/next.tar.xz (the modules)
    - /usr/src/next.tar.xz
      (empty if the 'prev' kernel didn't had the sources installed,
      pointed out by the /lib/modules/X/source symlink)

  the kernel present/active when this port was built:
    - /boot/prev (the 'uname -r' output of the kernel)
    - /boot/vmlinuz.prev (the kernel)
    - /boot/System.map.prev
    - /lib/modules/prev.tar.xz (the modules)
    - /usr/src/prev.tar.xz
      (empty if it didn't had the sources installed)

The post-install script will:
  - unpack the 'prev'/'next' modules in /lib/modules/tmp/,
  - unpack the 'next' sources in /usr/src/tmp/
  - create /lib/modules/autogenerated-cleanup.sh.tmp
    (containing the removal instructions)
  - run /lib/modules/autogenerated-cleanup.sh if exists
    (deleting the modules and the sources
     unpacked by the previous installation)
  - rename autogenerated-cleanup.sh.tmp to autogenerated-cleanup.sh
  - move the modules from /lib/modules/tmp/ to /lib/modules/
  - move the sources from /usr/src/tmp/ to /usr/src/
  - move the 'prev' and 'next' files from /boot/
    (vmlinuz.prev -> vmlinuz.old, vmlinuz.next -> vmlinuz)
  - run lilo or nothing (if grub or syslinux are used)
