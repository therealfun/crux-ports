1) Make sure your current kernel has /proc/config.gz. Otherwise,
   copy YOUR .config to /boot/config

2) Make sure your boot manager (lilo, syslinux, grub) is configured
   to use at least two entries: /boot/vmlinuz and /boot/vmlinuz.old.

3) Build this port, install it and run the post-install script
   if your package manager didn't run it.
   Make sure the post-install script finished without error.

4) !!! Check /boot/ and /lib/modules/ content and make sure
   your boot manager has been run, before rebooting !!!
   Your active/old kernel will be in /boot/vmlinuz.old
   while its modules /lib/modules/`uname -r` will be untouched.
   The new/built/next kernel will be in /boot/vmlinuz and
   /lib/modules/`cat /boot/next`.

!!! grub support is not tested yet !!!

pkgadd will add/install the following files:
  the kernel built by this Pkgfile:
    - /boot/next (the 'uname -r' output of the kernel)
    - /boot/vmlinuz.next (the kernel)
    - /boot/System.map.next
    - /lib/modules/next.tar.lz (the modules)
    - /usr/src/next.tar.lz
      (empty if the 'prev' kernel didn't had the sources installed,
      pointed out by the /lib/modules/X/source symlink)

  the kernel present/active when this port was built:
    - /boot/prev (the 'uname -r' output of the kernel)
    - /boot/vmlinuz.prev (the kernel)
    - /boot/System.map.prev
    - /lib/modules/prev.tar.lz (the modules)
    - /usr/src/prev.tar.lz
      (empty if it didn't had the sources installed)

The post-install script will:
  - unpack the 'prev'/'next' modules in /lib/modules/tmp/,
  - unpack the 'next' sources in /usr/src/tmp/
  - create /lib/modules/autogenerated-cleanup.sh.tmp
    (containing the removal instructions)
  - run /lib/modules/autogenerated-cleanup.sh if exists
    (deleting the modules and the sources
     unpacked by the previous installation)
  - rename autogenerated-cleanup.sh.tmp to autogenerated-cleanup.sh
  - move the sources from /usr/src/tmp/ to /usr/src/
  - move the modules from /lib/modules/tmp/ to /lib/modules/
  - move the 'prev' and 'next' files from /boot/
    (vmlinuz.prev -> vmlinuz.old, vmlinuz.next -> vmlinuz)
  - run lilo or nothing (if grub or syslinux are used)
