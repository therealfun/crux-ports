Make sure "/etc/localtime" points to:
	/usr/share/zoneinfo-leaps/<your-zone>
instead of:
	/usr/share/zoneinfo/<your-zone>

Set "NTP=your.ntp" in /etc/rc.conf if you want to use other NTP server
than "pool.ntp.org". In this case, make sure "getent hosts <your.ntp>"
prints the proper IP address.

Before starting the service, you may want to:
	- create a new drift file by removing /var/lib/clockspeed/etc/atto
	- sync the clock by running "sudo /etc/rc.d/clockspeed set"

Start the service:
	sudo /etc/rc.d/clockspeed start
If there is no drift file, it will check the clock after 12 seconds,
1 hour and 24 hours, to calculate/adjust the drift.

At any time, any user can see the difference between machine time and
ntp server time by running:
	/etc/rc.d/clockspeed show

You can trigger another check of ntp server time and adjust the
drift file by running:
	sudo /etc/rc.d/clockspeed adjust
You may want to do this after one month and after one year.

The log file is /var/log/clockspeed
